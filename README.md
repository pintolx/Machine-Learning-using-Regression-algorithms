# Machine-Learning-using-Regression-algorithms
Machine Learning using the Boston House Price dataset
The project will consist of step by step analysis of the Boston House Price dataset using Machine Learning regression algorithms. We shall basically go through 5 major steps which include;
1) Describing the problem at hand
2) Loading libraries and the data
3) Summarizing and exploring the data
4) Visualizing the data
5) Evaluating algorithms
6) Making predictions on the dataset.
